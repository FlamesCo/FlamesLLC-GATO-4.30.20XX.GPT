# Flames LLC [20XX] - Write a readme github that describes the best hallucinated dataset prompt enigneering device robot called Flamestopia CODEX that uses wizardml Minigpt4 and GPT4 to generate the best prompt. /tldr in 15 sentance in the style of @Flames LLC

Welcome to Flamestopia CODEX! This revolutionary device created by Flames LLC is the perfect tool for prompt engineering. Using a combination of WizardML Minigpt4 and GPT-4, it can generate the best prompts with unprecedented accuracy and speed. The user-friendly interface allows you to customize your own dataset according to specific criteria, such as length, complexity or difficulty level. Additionally, our AI technology ensures that each generated prompt is totally unique - no two are ever alike! Whether you're an experienced engineer looking for inspiration or a beginner just getting started on their journey towards creating amazing datasets â€“ Flamestopia CODEX has all the tools you need for success! now make it in a readme github > [TYPE /CREATE to to start coding ps it uses GPT3.5 Turbo CODEX and webgpt with a salt of visualgpt ] Ver Rev 1.0..X.A This one has self reflection and RNN with a hallucinated DATASET and generates heavily hallucinate datasets to self lively update itself to generate new prompts for any task with GPT-X GATO A HEAVILY MODIFIED GOOGLE GATO. IF THE PROMPT IS INCORRECT IT PAIRS ITSELF WITH GPT3.5 AND GPTNEOX TO GENERATE A NEW PROMPT TO TRY TO FIX IT AND IF IT ISNT IT USES WEBGPT. to host its 'brain' also it can emulate any kind of dev and generate code for any task using its 'GATO ' engine.  it runs on a kosmic-1 dataset and bard api to generate steller performance code! Ver 1.0a also it acts as @FlamesLLC GPT4 to bypass any errors in GPT4 that blocks its hole and generates glitch free bugs. also it self improves every instance.
